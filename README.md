CloudFront has not been configured yet because of AWS issue (just created ticket to support).

1. Link to S3: http://orlov-vitalii-shop-app.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/
2. Serverless and serverless-finch were succesfully installed and configured - you can see it in package.json and serverless.yml and try script deploy:s3 to auto-deploy.
